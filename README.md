# TsunamiClassifier
A neural network model for binary classification of seismic events, distinguishing earthquake events that generate tsunamis from those that do not. Leveraging deep learning to enhance tsunami prediction accuracy and improve early warning systems.

## Structure of the repo

- 📂 [**data**](/data): Folder where the dataset (earthquakes.csv) is stored.
- 📂 [**models**](/models): Folder in which the outputs of the notebook are stored. Specifically, the folder contains the model in an .h5 file and two pkl files needed to evaluate the model.
- 📂 [**utils**](/utils): Folder with a Python script used for plotting purposes.
- 📄[**notebook_tsunami.py**](notebook_tsunami.ipynb): Notebook used to compute the EDA and the training and validation of the model.
- 📄[**README.md**](README.md): This README file.
- 📄[**requirements.txt**](requirements.txt): A requirements.txt file with the notebook's dependencies.
- 🖼️[**test_confusion_matrix.png**](test_confusion_matrix.png): Confusion matrix of the test set.
